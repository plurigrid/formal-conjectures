The colouring `c` contains a monochromatic triangle congruent to `T`.

Since `T'` is arbitrary, relabellings and reflections of `T` are allowed. Rescaling is not.

  ∃ T' : Triangle ℝ ℝ², (T'.points ≅ T.points) ∧ ∃ i, ∀ j, c (T'.points j) = i

/--
In any $2$-colouring of $\mathbb{R}^2$, for all but at most one triangle $T$ (up to
congruence), there is a monochromatic congruent copy of $T$.

The colouring is arbitrary. No measurability is assumed. `≅` compares vertices with the same
label, so the conclusion allows a relabelling `σ`.

Shader [Sh76] proved that in any $2$-colouring of $\mathbb{R}^2$, every right-angled triangle
has a monochromatic congruent copy.

The exceptional triangle can exist: colouring the plane in alternating half-open strips of
suitable width gives no monochromatic copy of some equilateral triangle.
